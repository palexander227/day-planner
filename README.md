# day-planner
A simple planner to chart my work day.

I am submitting this assignment in partial fulfillment of the requirements of this course. I have made every effort to satisfy the requirements of this project.

This is a day-planner. Some ideas for future work on this project might involve how to integrate this with online calendar tools. A stand-alone planner might be really useful since it does not have all the complications of existing tools like Acuity or Google Calendar. But integrating this tool with other standard resources might be ver useful.

I am under serious time pressure to stay current with assignments so I did not develop this under 'normal' circumstances.
